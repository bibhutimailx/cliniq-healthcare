# 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX: Remove Lovable Placeholder

## 🚨 **Current Problem**
- ❌ cliniq.info shows Lovable placeholder page
- ❌ "Project not found" message
- ❌ Your ClinIQ app is not visible

## 🎯 **Root Cause**
The IONOS hosting is showing a Lovable placeholder instead of your uploaded files.

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**

### **Step 1: Check IONOS Hosting Configuration**

1. **Login to IONOS Control Panel**
   - Go to [ionos.com](https://ionos.com)
   - Login to your account

2. **Check Domain Settings**
   - Go to "Domains" → cliniq.info
   - Check if domain is pointing to correct hosting
   - Ensure it's not pointing to Lovable

3. **Check Web Hosting**
   - Go to "Web Hosting" → cliniq.info
   - Verify hosting is active and running

### **Step 2: Upload Your Files Again**

#### **Method A: File Manager (Recommended)**
1. **Access File Manager**
   - Go to Web Hosting → cliniq.info
   - Click "File Manager" or "FTP"
   - Navigate to `public_html` folder

2. **Delete ALL Files**
   - **DELETE EVERYTHING** in public_html
   - Make sure folder is completely empty
   - Remove any Lovable-related files

3. **Upload Your Files**
   - Upload `cliniq-deploy.zip` to public_html
   - **Extract the zip file**
   - Verify `index.html` is in the root

#### **Method B: FTP Upload**
```bash
# Get FTP credentials from IONOS
# Use FileZilla or any FTP client
# Upload all contents of dist/ folder to public_html
```

### **Step 3: Verify File Structure**
After upload, your public_html should contain:
```
public_html/
├── index.html          ← MUST be in root
├── config.js
├── .htaccess
├── favicon.ico
├── robots.txt
├── placeholder.svg
└── assets/
    ├── index-BhZHUmV0.js
    └── index-Bkh0CVhT.css
```

### **Step 4: Check .htaccess File**
Ensure `.htaccess` is uploaded and contains:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Handle React Router
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html [QSA,L]
```

### **Step 5: Test the Site**
1. Visit https://cliniq.info
2. Should show ClinIQ dashboard (not Lovable placeholder)
3. Check browser console for errors

## 🔧 **If Still Showing Lovable**

### **Check DNS Settings:**
1. **IONOS DNS Management**
   - Go to Domains → cliniq.info → DNS
   - Check A record points to your hosting IP
   - Remove any CNAME records pointing to Lovable

2. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Press Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
   - Clear browser cache completely

3. **Check for CDN/Proxy**
   - IONOS might be using Cloudflare
   - Check if there are proxy settings

### **Alternative: Use Vercel (Recommended)**
If IONOS continues to have issues:

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel instead
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

Then point your domain to Vercel.

## 🚨 **Emergency Fix Commands**

### **Recreate Deployment Package:**
```bash
# Build fresh deployment package
npm run build
cd dist
zip -r ../cliniq-deploy.zip .
cd ..
```

### **Test Locally First:**
```bash
# Test your build locally
npm run preview
# Visit http://localhost:4173
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result**
After proper upload:
- ✅ Site loads at https://cliniq.info
- ✅ Shows ClinIQ dashboard (not Lovable)
- ✅ All features work (speech, multilingual)
- ✅ No placeholder pages

## 🔄 **Quick Test**
After uploading, test these URLs:
- https://cliniq.info (should show ClinIQ dashboard)

Your site will be fixed once Lovable placeholder is removed! 🚀
