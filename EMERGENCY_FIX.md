# 🚨 EMERGENCY FIX: cliniq.info Showing Code Instead of App

## 🚨 **Current Problem**
- ✅ Local site works: `http://localhost:8080` 
- ❌ Live site broken: `https://cliniq.info` shows "Project not found"

## 🎯 **Root Cause**
The files are not properly uploaded to IONOS hosting or the hosting isn't configured correctly.

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**

### **Step 1: Verify IONOS Hosting**
1. **Login to IONOS Control Panel**
   - Go to [ionos.com](https://ionos.com)
   - Login to your account

2. **Check Hosting Status**
   - Go to "Web Hosting" 
   - Verify cliniq.info has active hosting
   - Check if hosting is running

### **Step 2: Upload Files Correctly**

#### **Option A: File Manager (Recommended)**
1. **Access File Manager**
   - Click on cliniq.info hosting
   - Click "File Manager" or "FTP"
   - Navigate to `public_html` folder

2. **Clear Existing Files**
   - **DELETE ALL FILES** in public_html
   - Make sure folder is completely empty

3. **Upload New Files**
   - Upload `cliniq-deploy.zip` to public_html
   - **Extract the zip file**
   - Verify `index.html` is in the root

#### **Option B: FTP Upload**
```bash
# Get FTP credentials from IONOS
# Use any FTP client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, etc.)
# Upload all contents of dist/ folder to public_html
```

### **Step 3: Verify File Structure**
After upload, your public_html should contain:
```
public_html/
├── index.html          ← MUST be in root
├── config.js
├── .htaccess
├── favicon.ico
├── robots.txt
├── placeholder.svg
└── assets/
    ├── index-BhZHUmV0.js
    └── index-Bkh0CVhT.css
```

### **Step 4: Test the Site**
1. Visit https://cliniq.info
2. Should show ClinIQ dashboard (not code)
3. Check browser console for errors

## 🔧 **If Still Not Working**

### **Check IONOS Settings:**
1. **Domain DNS**: Ensure cliniq.info points to hosting
2. **SSL Certificate**: Enable HTTPS
3. **PHP Version**: Set to PHP 8.0 or higher
4. **Error Pages**: Disable custom error pages

### **Alternative: Use Vercel (Easier)**
If IONOS continues to have issues:

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel instead
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

Then point your domain to Vercel.

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: "Project not found"**
**Solution**: Files not uploaded to correct location
- Upload to `public_html` folder
- Ensure `index.html` is in root

### **Issue: White screen**
**Solution**: JavaScript errors
- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify all asset files uploaded

### **Issue: 404 errors**
**Solution**: Missing .htaccess file
- Ensure .htaccess is uploaded
- Check IONOS supports .htaccess

### **Issue: API errors**
**Solution**: Check config.js
- Verify API keys in config.js
- Check CORS settings

## 📞 **IONOS Support**
If you need immediate help:
- **Live Chat**: Available in IONOS Control Panel
- **Phone**: Check your account for support number
- **Email**: support@ionos.com

## 🎯 **Expected Result**
After proper upload:
- ✅ Site loads at https://cliniq.info
- ✅ Shows ClinIQ dashboard (not code)
- ✅ All features work (speech, multilingual)
- ✅ No console errors

## 🔄 **Quick Test**
After uploading, test these URLs:
- https://cliniq.info (should show dashboard)
- https://cliniq.info/consultation (should work)
- https://cliniq.info/reports (should work)

Your site will be fixed once files are properly uploaded! 🚀
